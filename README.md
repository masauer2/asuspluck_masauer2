# ASU SPLUNK STUDENT WORKER TECHNICAL APPLICATION

This repository holds the edited files for the technical application portion of the ASU Splunk student worker application.
The richest_five.py file takes a json file as input, more specifically the accounts.json file, parses the information based off of the balance of each bank account and prints, in descending order, the five accounts with the highest balance. 

Changes have been made to the accounts.json file to allow the file to be properly converted to a python list. Syntax edits have been made to the richest_five.py file, along with fixes to logical errors so that the proper parameters are utilized to print out the largest bank accounts in descending order.
